Build Process
=============

The application is built firstly on linux, and the output directed to
a common server location. This server location is then used by subsequent
Windows and MacOS builds to enable them to use the same build artifacts.

1. On Linux, ./build_linux.rb /mnt/build/obzvault
2. On Windows, ./build_win32.bat \\server\build\obzvault
3. On MacOS, ./build_macos.rb /Volumes/build/obzvault
