------
OBZVault was one of the products released by OffByZero Pty. Ltd.; the original product page is [here](http://www.offbyzero.com/obzvault).  We have subsequently re-licensed OBZVault under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and created a GitHub project to host it.

### why the LGPL?
The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD license (and similar) don't mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed library are required to release source code to that library if they change it.
